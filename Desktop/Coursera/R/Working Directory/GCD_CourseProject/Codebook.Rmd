SETUP:
Multiple data sets with data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone are to be merged into a single one. The expected outcome is a single tidy data set with relevant columns as specified, that can be used for further analyses.

RAW DATA:
Brief and detailed descriptions of the different data points provided can be found in the 'features.txt' and 'features_info.txt' files in the raw data. I'll not repeat those here.

Following are the data frame variables used in the script while reading in the inputs. Each of them has been used to store data from eponymous files with raw data.
X_test
X_train
y_test
y_train
subject_test
subject_train
activity_labels

Apart from this, 
col_names_measurements is a data frame used to store column names read in from features.txt 

INTERMEDIATE / TRANSFORMATION VARIABLES:
These variables have been used in making and storing transformations through the script. Following is a list of these:

X : Data frame created by merging X_test & X_train

y : Data frame created by merging y_test & y_train

subjects : 
Data frame created by merging subject_test & subject_train

consol_data : 
Data frame with 561 columns, created by merging X,subjects & y

relv_cols_mean : 
Numeric array used to store column indices for column names ending with "mean()"

relv_cols_std : 
Numeric array used to store column indices for column names ending with "std()"

relv_cols : 
Numeric array created by combining relv_cols_mean & rel_col_std

columns : 
Numeric variable to store the no. of columns in consol_data

relv_dataset : 
Data frame with relevant columns, extracted from consol_data

activity_codes : 
Factor array with activity codes from consol_data

activity_desc : 
Factor array with activity codes replaced by descriptions

consol_data2 : 
Data frame created by merging relv_dataset, subjects & activity_desc

relv_cols_names : 
Factor array with names for relevant columns, extracted from col_names_measurements

temp : 
Temporary data frame to hold average values once they're calculated in the loop

temp_names : 
Temporary character array to hold names of columns in output as they're being changed


OUTPUT

tidy_data : 
Data frame, generated as per instructions in assignment and adhering to tidy data norms in Hadley Wickham's Tidy Data paper

tidy_data.txt : A text file with the tidy_data set
